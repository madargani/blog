Hello! My name is Andre. This is my first Post.

I built this website using Hugo and GitHub Pages. Hugo is a popular static site generator. Hugo allows me to write these posts as markdown files which are then converted into static HTML files. This files are finally pushed to my GitHub Pages site which is where you are viewing this now!

I have two main goals for this website. First, I want to secure an internship. I want to use this site to showcase my knowledge, skills, and experiences to potential employers. Second, I want to document my projects and learning progress. I think it's really rewarding being able to look back and see how much I've accomplished and how much I've grown. I also when I can't find a project that I worked on in the past. This will hopefully solve that problem.

# Markdown

To complete this post I'll give a quick overview of Markdown Language.

## Headers

```markdown
Use hashtags to indicate headers 
# level 1 header 
## level 2 header
### level 3 header 
```

## Lists

```markdown
- unordered
- list

1. ordered
2. list

- [x] checked
- [ ] unchecked
```

## Tables

```markdown
| Column1 | Column2 | Column3 |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Item1.1 | Item2.1 | Item3.1 |
| Item1.2 | Item2.2 | Item3.2 |
```

## Links

```markdown
Surround links in alligator brackets
<https://google.com>
```

There are more features of Markdown Language, but these are the basics. I'll leave a link for a more extensive guide below. Thanks for reading! I'll catch you in the next post.
