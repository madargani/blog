Lately I've been interested in building my own homelab.
Ideally I would like to have a setup that allows me to store my files remotely and experiment with cybersecurity techniques.
Originally I wanted to find a used computer to host my homelab, but I got a Raspberry Pi 5 for Christmas!
In this post I will go over the steps I went through to set up NextCloud on my Pi.

## NextCloud

## Equipment Used
- Raspberry Pi
- External Hard Drive

For my setup I used a Western Digital 1TB My Book External Hard Drive, however external HDD or SSD that can connect to the Pi through USB should work.
